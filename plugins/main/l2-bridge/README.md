# l2-bridge plugin

## Overview

With l2-bridge plugin, all containers (on the same host) are plugged into a bridge (virtual switch) that resides in the host network namespace.
The containers receive one end of the veth pair with the other end connected to the bridge.
No IP address is assigned to the veth pair.

The network configuration specifies the name of the bridge to be used.
If the bridge is missing, the plugin will fail.

## Example configuration
```
{
	"cniVersion": "0.3.0",
	"type": "l2-bridge",
	"bridge": "mynet0",
	"ipam": {}
}
```
